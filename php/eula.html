<h1>gsync - Terms of Use</h1>
<p>
  gsync is a Git-like file synchronization service, mainly intended for personal development use.
  Please read the following terms carefully before using the service.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>"file-sync-feature" is the serivce for upload/download file objects in repositories, served via index.php</li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You must access the "file-sync-feature" only through the client software provided at
      <a href="https://github.com/hoge1e3/acepad-git/tree/main/node" target="_blank">
        https://github.com/hoge1e3/acepad-git/tree/main/node
      </a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Each repository has a Repository ID issued by the "file-sync-feature" service.  
      Knowing this Repository ID is effectively the only requirement to access the repository.  
      There is no strong authentication mechanism in place.
    </li>
    <li>
      You must also provide an API key (any random string) when using the file-sync-feature client.  
      This key is not used for authentication but only recorded in access logs 
      to help identify the source of requests.
    </li>
    <li>
      Anyone who knows your Repository ID and API key can access your repository data.  
      Keep them secret. If they are leaked, your data may be accessed, modified, or deleted by others.  
      The maintainer is not responsible for any unauthorized access.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>The “manager” service manages access permissions for each repository, allowing or denying access based on specified API keys. The features are served via manage.php</li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      To log in to the “manager” service, you must set a password for the repository. 
    </li>
    <li>
      If no password is set to a repository, 
      the user who first access to the repository via 'manager' can set the password. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Once password is set, it cannot be changed. And it cannot be recovered if you forget it.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    Your data, including some past history, is stored on the server without encryption.  
    History retention is not guaranteed, and older history may be archived or removed in the future.
  </li>
  <li>
    Currently there is no strict storage quota. However, limits may be introduced in the future 
    if usage grows. Excessive use of bandwidth, storage, or requests may result in suspension of service.
  </li>
  <li>
    You may not store illegal content, infringe intellectual property rights, or upload harmful data.  
    Any use that interferes with the service or other users is prohibited.
  </li>
  <li>
    This service is primarily for personal development use. Commercial or mission-critical use 
    is entirely at your own risk.
  </li>
  <li>
    The service may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time without notice.  
    Data may be deleted upon service termination.
  </li>
  <li>
    The maintainer provides this service “as is” without any warranties.  
    No responsibility is taken for data loss, service interruptions, or any damages 
    arising from the use of this service.
  </li>
  <li>
    These Terms of Use may be updated without prior notice.  
    Continued use of the service after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.
  </li>
</ul>
